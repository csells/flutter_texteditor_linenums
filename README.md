# flutter_texteditor_linenums
A sample of a text field with line numbers in Flutter

![screen capture](readme/screencap.gif)

This sample shows off the following:
- creating line numbers on the fly via `ListView.builder`
- re-calculating line number heights as text changes based on wrapping
- re-calculating line number heights when the `TextField` size changes
- automatically showing scrollbars when there's a enough text to scroll
